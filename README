DoorDash Android Take-Home Project

Implements an Activity showing basic information on restaurants found near a specific geo-location.
The screen is implemented in FinderFragment, which is added into FinderActivity.
This was done particularly to inject a ViewModel dependency into the Fragment to make testing easier by
mocking FinderViewModel. This is otherwise tricky to inject into an Activity.

Architecture used was a UI - ViewModel - Repository.
The goal is to be able to test Activity by mocking ViewModel, to test ViewModel by mocking Repository etc.

Libraries/dependencies used:
Retrofit to make api calls and process response, along with GSON for converting json data into model objects.
Picasso to load images into views using urls.
Mockk to mock objects in test code.

Tests:
Wrote 2 tests to demonstrate how the main fragment and ViewModel can be tested by mocking their dependencies.
FinderFragment was tested using androidTest with Espresso.
FinderViewModel was tested with simple junit unit tests.
RestaurantRepository tests were not written, but will follow a similar approach to the ViewModel test.
